## Two Pointers
- The naive approach to solve problem would be using nested loops, with time complexity of O(n2).
- Using two pointers moving towards the middle from either end would more efficient with a time complexity of O(n)

## Fast and Slow Pointers
- The pointers start at the same location, but they move forward at different speeds.
